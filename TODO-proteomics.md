* Check how MDS is calculated - should use log intensity?
* Don't show low "counts" filtering on config page
* Don't show counts specific options in "extra" on config page
* QC plots - which ones makes sense?
* double-click link on table default to somewhere sensible - uniprot? (not ensmbl?)


* Analysis script, and options.  eg, imputation.  Other filtering?
